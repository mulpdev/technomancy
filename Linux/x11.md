# x11 snap ubuntu
snap applications run inside of a chroot-like environment in `${HOME}`
X11 uses `~/.Xauthority` to store auth keys. 

Using X11 with a snap app will throw an error about "unsupported security protocol or authorization"

inside `~/snap/{app}/common` make a symlink to that file rel/abspath prepended
`ln -s ~/.Xauthority ~/snap/{app}/common`
