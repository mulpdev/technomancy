```
1. Go to about:config
    
2. Search for ' **image.http.accept** '
    
3. Edit the preferences of that (Or click the little pencil button) to open an editing field
    
4. Put */* there and save it.
    

This keeps webps but allows you to go to wikia/fandom places and natively save them as whatever their actual file type is.
